# Frontend

This is the frontend UI of the application. It is built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements

To successfully run the frontend, you need to update the `__BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT__` in the `index.html` file with the port number of the backend service.

This is automatically set when you run the backend service using the `docker-compose` file.
